# Team Whatever’s Project

Basic Overview goes here!

## Description

We’re making whatever game we decide on, it’ll be super cool though.


## The “Whatever” Team

### Kyle Moorhead – Team Lead

I am on my last semester (hopefully) graduating in December. I’m 30 years old and looking forward to moving on to the next chapter of my life. Python is my go-to, but I have some experience with Java, PHP, and JS. My hobbies and interests primarily involve playing video games, though I also enjoy hockey, backwoods camping, and TTRPGs. 


### Ted Gravlin - Deputy Team Lead

I'm 21 years old and in my last semester at EMU. I love making websites and programs that make people's lives easier and more fun. I'm good with Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Python, some C++, and some Kotlin.


### Adrian A. Gonzalez - Team Member 

I am currently on my last semester and receiving my bachelors in December. I am a Computer Science major and have been studying programming for 3+ years with more experience in Java than anything else. I am 23 years old and I live in a town 20 minutes north of the campus. I enjoy video games, watching anime, and I am currently learning Japanese through Duolingo.


### Nadya Novak - Team Member

Super senior on my (hopefully) last semester. Used to be a polisci major, switched to compsci, still kept polisci as my minor though. 28, and looking towards what's going to come next (with some apprehension). Most comfortable with Java, Javascript and C#, some experience with C++ and Ruby, but not against learning something new. I enjoy gaming, swimming and writing, and make my own kombucha. In adition to English, I also speak Russian and am activley learning French.



### Kevin Hammermeister - Team Member

Senior graduating this semester. Very experienced in programming with Java, C, and Python. Also very comfortable with git and GitHub, have used a lot up to this point. I work part time at a dog daycare currently and have a great time doing it while I’m in school. 


### Matt Braun - Team Member

Gonna be graduating at the end of this semester with a bachelors in computer science. I don't particularly enjoy programming outside of class  (personal projects) but I 'm too far in to switch majors. I can however get done whatever you need of me in our project within any given deadlines. Good grasp of Java and fundamental understanding of python.  I feel very comfortable with Github, but I might need a refresher on testing. I work on campus at the IT Helpdesk most days and have been there a little over a year.


### Name: Alex - Team Member

Super senior majoring in Data Science & analytics, part time intern. Goal is to learn something new each day, to get a little more informed each day.
