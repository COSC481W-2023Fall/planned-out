## Team Whatever:

### Kyle Moorhead – Team Lead

I am on my last semester (hopefully) graduating in December. I’m 30 years old and looking forward to moving on to the next chapter of my life. Python is my go-to, but I have some experience with Java, PHP, and JS. My hobbies and interests primarily involve playing video games, though I also enjoy hockey, backwoods camping, and TTRPGs.

### Ted Gravlin - Deputy Team Lead

I'm 21 years old and in my last semester at EMU. I love making websites and programs that make people's lives easier and more fun. I'm good with Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Python, some C++, and some Kotlin.

### Adrian A. Gonzalez - Team Member

I am currently on my last semester and receiving my bachelors in December. I am a Computer Science major and have been studying programming for 3+ years with more experience in Java than anything else. I am 23 years old and I live in a town 20 minutes north of the campus. I enjoy video games, watching anime, and I am currently learning Japanese through Duolingo.

### Nadya Novak - Team Member

Super senior on my (hopefully) last semester. Used to be a polisci major, switched to compsci, still kept polisci as my minor though. 28, and looking towards what's going to come next (with some apprehension). Most comfortable with Java, Javascript and C#, some experience with C++ and Ruby, but not against learning something new. I enjoy gaming, swimming and writing, and make my own kombucha. In adition to English, I also speak Russian and am activley learning French.

### Kevin Hammermeister - Team Member

Senior graduating this semester. Very experienced in programming with Java, C, and Python. Also very comfortable with git and GitHub, have used a lot up to this point. I work part time at a dog daycare currently and have a great time doing it while I’m in school.

### Matt Braun - Team Member

Gonna be graduating at the end of this semester with a bachelors in computer science. I don't particularly enjoy programming outside of class (personal projects) but I 'm too far in to switch majors. I can however get done whatever you need of me in our project within any given deadlines. Good grasp of Java and fundamental understanding of python. I feel very comfortable with Github, but I might need a refresher on testing. I work on campus at the IT Helpdesk most days and have been there a little over a year.

### Name: Alex - Team Member

Super senior majoring in Data Science & analytics, part time intern. Goal is to learn something new each day, to get a little more informed each day.

## Acknowledgments

Professor Jiang is awesome!

## Testing

### Frontend

To run frontend tests, run `npm test` in the front-end directory.

All frontend tests are located in the `front-end/src/tests` directory.

A couple example tests have been made for the `App` component. Please don't delete these tests, as they are a good example of how to write tests for React components.

You can write multiple tests in a file. These files are referred to as 'test suites'

We will use the naming convention {PageName}.test.js for our test suites.

### Backend

The Backend testing is all ran through "frontend" as of now. This is because most frontend actions will require a REST call to the server. This may be changed later as needed if there are background server tasks that need tested seperately.
